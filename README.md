# webpage
## __Unprofessional readme below__ 
My portfolio webpage, hosted on netlify. 
Feel free to steal my code or whatever, this is just the front end. 
Personal challenge in this small project is to write my portfolio in semantic html5 format as well as semantic es7 (soon). 
Will add more ramblings as I continue developing

## Note 
I barely have any knowledge with github cli so you may see very weird changes throughout the entirety of this repository. I've deleted my files (and backups) by accident twice already..
